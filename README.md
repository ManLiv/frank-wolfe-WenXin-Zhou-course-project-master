# frank-wolfe-WenXin-Zhou-course-project-master

## About
This is the course project of "Network Design and Optimization" given by Prof.Xiaolei Wang. This project requires to implement the frank-wolfe algorithm for static traffic assignment problem (TAP) with monotonically increasing convex objective function and equilibrium constraints.

## Dependencies
The codes are implemented under Ubuntu 18.04, gcc version 7.5.0. Boost C++ 1.71.0 is also required for running the codes.

## How to use this project
After installing all the dependencies, one can easily run the codes by directly calling Makefile in termination to compile the project. To test the efficiencies of the algorithm on different networks, one can refer to https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks for details.
